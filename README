Time::HiRes module: High resolution time, sleep, and alarm.

Implement usleep, ualarm, and gettimeofday for Perl, as well as wrappers
to implement time, sleep, and alarm that know about non-integral seconds.

Note that your underlying operating system must have the usleep(),
ualarm(), and gettimeofday() routines, or you will get "Undefined
externals" messages when building or testing this. I *may* be able to
help in this case, see the documentation.

POD documentation is embedded.
